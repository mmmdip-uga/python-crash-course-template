## How to Check Your Grade
**Method 1: The Badge**

* **Note:** It may take 1-2 minutes to update after you push your code. Refresh the page to see the change.

**Method 2: Detailed Logs**
If the badge is red or you want to see exactly which test failed:
1. Click on the **Actions** tab at the top of this repository.
2. Click on the latest workflow run (usually named "GitHub Classroom Workflow").
3. Click on the **Autograding** job to see the logs.
4. Scroll down to see which specific tests passed or failed.

## Local Testing
You can run the tests on your own computer to check your progress before pushing to GitHub. Open your terminal/command prompt in this folder and run:

python3 -m unittest test_assignment.py

* If everything is correct, you will see `OK` at the bottom.
* If you see `FAILED`, read the error messages to see which part needs fixing.
